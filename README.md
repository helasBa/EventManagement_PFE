# EventManagement_PFE
In my final year of studies in 2021, I created a mobile app using React Native Expo, Node.js, and Express.
The app was designed for a society in Sousse, Tunisia, and connected to their database for data. 
This project gave me hands-on experience with modern technologies like React Native and Node.js, 
helping me develop practical skills in mobile app development.
